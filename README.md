# Sel Portrait


## Bootcamp Challenge 2

  The purpose of this excercise is to create a ground up webiste featuring a self portfolio of information Aoubt Me, examples of My Work and Contact information.

- Motivation: Utilize skills learned in CSS and HTML in building a website.  In this process, reinforce knowledge learned through practical application of CSS styling and positioning, as well as HTML construction.

- Project: Build a ground up website.  Make the theme a "self portfolio" of information About Me, examples of My Work and Contact information.  Also include links in the header to connect to About Me, My Work and Contact Me.  Include a picture of myself and personalized styling.  Have page's styling be variable to various media.

- Lessons Learned: Many...  Positioning certain elements were challenging.  For the header, I wanted to use an existing pic of my motorcycle, but align a slice of it to feature the Harley Davidson emblem and the kayaker.  For the <div> just underneath the header, also had to fine tune positioning to feature a slice of the pic used.  The main <div>'s ".sub-box" class, the <div> ".side" class and the separate <div>'s for About Me, etc., taught me about positioning elements using Flex styling.  Challenging....  Still not complete, as I need to provide more examples of My Work, however a <div> exists for this already.  I spent too much time focusing on styling vs focusing on the mission.  However, in that process learned more refined shadowing techniques for text-shadow.  Lastly, lesson learned using GitHub.  My first submission somehow wound up containging the README.MD from Challenge 1.  Hence, this resubmission.

## Coding

- Header:   In the header, I used CSS positioning to fine tune placement of the pic used for aesthetcs.  Wanted a specific slice of the pic used to feature the Harley Davidson emblem and kayaker.  For the text, learned about using text-shadow multiple times with different criteria to give an embossed look.  I'm a creative person by nature (I write music/play guitar, paint, etc) and gravitated towards experimenting with styling techniques.
  
  - Main:  Created class .sub-box to divide the page into the sections for the links.  Within these containers, created additional <div>'s which would hold consistent styling.  Each .sub-box has a left side aligned class .side, to feature a right side border and text alignment to the corresponding section to it's right.  Also, the text in .side connectss to the link in the header

  - .about-me:  Worked on picture placement to be just to right of the text and then as the page shrinks, the image expands to see my entire body vs just my head if the page is fully expanded.  Used text-shadown techinques for shadowing/embossing.
  
  - .my-work:  Split this <div> into 2 sections in a column, with the top section featuring a pic and link to Run-Buddy.  In the lower section, while not populated, additional dives for 4 additional <div>'s have been created for additional exmaples of work.  Vistually, the top section is more prominently shown, while the lower section visually is secondary containing the 4 additional <div>'s for work examples.

  - Footer (.contact-box):  Footer contains .side to have visual continuity to where .side is used in main, and also contains the link to the header.  Made to additional <div>'s to hold actual contact info, and then reuse the code from the header for the links
