# Code Refactor Starter Code


## Bootcamp Challenge 2

  The purpose of this excercise is to create a ground up webiste featuring a self portfolio of information Aoubt Me, examples of My Work and Contact information.

- Motivation: Utilize skills learned in CSS and HTML in building a website.  In this process, reinforce knowledge learned through practical application of CSS styling and positioning, as well as HTML construction.

- Project: Build a ground up website.  Make the theme a "self portfolio" of information About Me, examples of My Work and Contact information.  Also include links in the header to connect to About Me, My Work and Contact Me.  Include a picture of myself and personalized styling.  Have page's styling be variable to various media.

- Lessons Learned: Many...  Positioning certain elements were challenging.  For the header, I wanted to use an existing pic of my motorcycle, but align a slice of it to feature the Harley Davidson emblem and the kayaker.  For the <div> just underneath the header, also had to fine tune positioning to feature a slice of the pic used.  The main <div>'s, the <div> ".side" class and the <div> ".sub-box" class taught me about positioning elements using Flex styling.  Challenging....  Still not complete, as I need to provide more examples of My Work, however a <div> exists for this already.  Lastly, lesson learned using GitHub.  My first submission somehow wound up containging the README.MD from Challenge 1.  Hence, this resubmission.

## Coding

- In each of these sections, separate <div>'s to contain additional containers, and then is CSS, use Flex styling for use with various media.  Also, made a subsection in the category <div> along the left side to hold the link from the header and align to the sub <div> holding the About Me, My Work, etc.  In the header, I used CSS positioning to fine tune placement of the pic used for aesthetcs, as well as the pic used for the <div> just under the header.  

- Identified non operable link for Seach Engine Optimization (line 13) and fixed by adding the id "search-engine-optimization" under <main class="content" / figure       class="content-pic">, line 32
